Task 2

To develop a smart AI agent for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe that can never be beaten.  
This helped me understand how recursive search and decision-making works in turn-based games.


Concepts Used

- Minimax algorithm  
- Alpha-beta pruning  
- Game tree search  
- Board evaluation  
- Player vs AI interaction


How to Run

1. Open `tictactoe.py` in any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, or Pydroid)
2. Run the script
3. The board will be printed and you’ll be asked to enter a number from 0 to 8 to place your move
4. The AI will automatically make its move after yours
5. Game continues until you or the AI wins, or it's a draw



What I Learned

- How AI makes optimal decisions using Minimax  
- How Alpha-Beta pruning improves efficiency  
- How to implement turn-based games in Python
